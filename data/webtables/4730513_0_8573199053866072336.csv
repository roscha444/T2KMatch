"1869","dmitri mendeleev","arranged elements into 7 groups with similar properties.&nbsp; he discovered that the properties of elements&nbsp; were periodic functions of the their atomic  weights.&nbsp; this became known as the periodic law."
"1873","james clerk maxwell","proposed electric and magnetic fields filled the void."
"1879&nbsp;","sir william crookes","discovered cathode rays had the following properties: travel in straight lines from the cathode; cause glass to fluoresce; impart a negative charge to objects they strike; are deflected by electric fields and magnets to suggest a negative charge; cause pinwheels in their path to spin indicating they have mass.&nbsp;"
"1886","e. goldstein&nbsp;","used a crt to study canal rays which had electrical and magnetic properties opposite of an electron.&nbsp;"
"1894&nbsp;","g.j. stoney","proposed that electricity was made of discrete negative particles he called electrons . (link to info on electrons)"
"1895&nbsp;","wilhelm roentgen","using a crt he observed that nearby chemicals glowed. further experiments found very penetrating rays coming from the crt that were not deflected by a magnetic field. he named them x-rays.&nbsp;"

"1911&nbsp;","ernest rutherford","using alpha particles as atomic  bullets probed the atoms in a piece of thin (0.00006 cm) gold foil . he established that the nucleus was: very densevery small and positively charged. he also assumed that the electrons were located outside the nucleus.&nbsp;"
"1914&nbsp;","h.g.j. moseley","using x-ray tubes determined the charges on the nuclei of most atoms. he wrotethe atomic  number of an element is equal to the number of protons in the nucleus. this work was used to reorganize the periodic table based upon atomic  number instead of atomic  mass."
